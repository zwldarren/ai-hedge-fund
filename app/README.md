# AI Hedge Fund [WIP] 🚧

This project is currently a work in progress. To track progress, please get updates [here](https://x.com/virattt).

The AI Hedge Fund app is a complete system with both frontend and backend components that enables you to run an AI-powered hedge fund trading system through a web interface.

## Overview

The AI Hedge Fund consists of:

- **Backend**: A FastAPI application that provides a REST API to run the hedge fund trading system and backtester
- **Frontend**: A React/Vite application that offers a user-friendly interface to visualize and control the hedge fund operations

## Quick Setup

Follow these steps to get both the frontend and backend running:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm for the frontend
- Python 3.8+ and Poetry for the backend

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

2. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Edit the .env file to add your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

4. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

5. Install root project dependencies:
```bash
# From the root directory
poetry install
```

6. Install backend app dependencies:
```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd app/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt  # If there's a requirements.txt file
# OR
poetry install  # If there's a pyproject.toml in the backend directory
```

7. Install frontend app dependencies:
```bash
cd app/frontend
npm install  # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
# In one terminal, from the backend directory
cd app/backend
poetry run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

2. Start the frontend application:
```bash
# In another terminal, from the frontend directory
cd app/frontend
npm run dev
```
