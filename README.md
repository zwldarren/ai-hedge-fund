# AI Hedge Fund

An AI-powered hedge fund that uses multiple agents to make trading decisions. The system employs several specialized agents working together:

1. Market Data Agent - Gathers and preprocesses market data
2. Quantitative Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
3. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
4. Risk Management Agent - Evaluates portfolio risk and sets position limits
5. Portfolio Management Agent - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

## Usage

### Running the Hedge Fund

```bash
poetry run python src/agents.py --ticker AAPL
```

### Running the Hedge Fund (with Reasoning)
This will print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
poetry run python src/agents.py --ticker AAPL --show-reasoning
```

**Example Output:**
```
==========         Quant Agent          ==========
{
  "signal": "bearish",
  "confidence": 0.5,

========================================

==========    Risk Management Agent     ==========
{
  "max_position_size": 10000.0,
  "risk_score": 6,
  "trading_action": "hold",
  "reasoning": "The overall signal is bearish with moderate confidence, indicated by overbought RSI and price above the Bollinger band, suggesting potential downside. However, the bullish OBV could offset some bearish pressure. Therefore, it's prudent to hold off on new positions until clearer direction emerges."
}
========================================

==========  Portfolio Management Agent  ==========
{
  "action": "hold",
  "quantity": 0,
  "reasoning": "The team's analysis indicates a bearish outlook with moderate confidence due to overbought RSI and price above the Bollinger band, while the bullish OBV suggests some counterbalancing. The risk management team recommends holding off on new positions until clearer direction emerges. Additionally, the current portfolio has no shares to sell, and the risk profile advises against new purchases."
}
