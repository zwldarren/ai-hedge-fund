# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
2. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
3. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
4. Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
5. Warren Buffett Agent - Uses Warren Buffett's principles to generate trading signals
6. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
7. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

**Note**: the system simulates trading decisions, it does not actually trade.

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Set your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
# Get your OpenAI API key from https://platform.openai.com/
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
# Get your Groq API key from https://groq.com/
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
# Get your Financial Datasets API key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must to set the OpenAI API key or Groq API key for the hedge fund to work.  This depends on the LLM you are using.  If you want to use LLMs from both providers, you will need to set both API keys.

Financial data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key.

For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## Usage

### Running the Hedge Fund
```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**

You can also specify a `--show-reasoning` flag to print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning
```
You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions for a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01 
```

### Running the Backtester

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA
```

**Example Output:**
<img width="941" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-06 at 5 47 52 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00e794ea-8628-44e6-9a84-8f8a31ad3b47" />

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to backtest over a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```
