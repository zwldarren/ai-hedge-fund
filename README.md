# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Aswath Damodaran Agent - The Dean of Valuation, focuses on story, numbers, and disciplined valuation
2. Ben Graham Agent - The godfather of value investing, only buys hidden gems with a margin of safety
3. Bill Ackman Agent - An activist investor, takes bold positions and pushes for change
4. Cathie Wood Agent - The queen of growth investing, believes in the power of innovation and disruption
5. Charlie Munger Agent - Warren Buffett's partner, only buys wonderful businesses at fair prices
6. Michael Burry Agent - The Big Short contrarian who hunts for deep value
7. Peter Lynch Agent - Practical investor who seeks "ten-baggers" in everyday businesses
8. Phil Fisher Agent - Meticulous growth investor who uses deep "scuttlebutt" research 
9. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala Agent - The Big Bull of India
10. Stanley Druckenmiller Agent - Macro legend who hunts for asymmetric opportunities with growth potential
11. Warren Buffett Agent - The oracle of Omaha, seeks wonderful companies at a fair price
12. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
13. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
14. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
15. Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
16. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
17. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

As of June 2025, there are **two ways** to run the AI Hedge Fund:

1. **🖥️ Full-Stack Web Application** - User-friendly web interface (recommended for most users)
2. **⌨️ Command Line Interface** - Terminal-based approach for developers and advanced users

**Note**: the system simulates trading decisions, it does not actually trade.

## How to Install the AI Hedge Fund

Before you can run the AI Hedge Fund, you'll need to install it and set up your API keys. These steps are common to both the full-stack web application and command line interface.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

### 2. Set Up Your API Keys

Create a `.env` file for your API keys:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys (in the root directory)
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to add your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by openai (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, etc.)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set at least one LLM API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) for the hedge fund to work. 

**Financial Data**: Data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key. For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.

## How to Run the AI Hedge Fund

### 🖥️ Web Application (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the AI Hedge Fund is through our web application that provides a user-friendly interface. **This is recommended for most users, especially those who prefer visual interfaces over command line tools.**

<img width="1692" alt="Screenshot 2025-05-15 at 8 57 56 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2173fa5b-1029-49dd-8b04-d7583616de1b" />

#### 🚀 Quick Start

**One-line setup and run command:**

#### For Mac/Linux:
```bash
cd app && ./run.sh
```

If you get a "permission denied" error, run this first:
```bash
cd app && chmod +x run.sh && ./run.sh
```

#### For Windows:
```cmd
cd app && run.bat
```

**That's it!** These scripts will:
1. Check for required dependencies (Node.js, Python, Poetry)
2. Install all dependencies automatically  
3. Start both frontend and backend services
4. **Automatically open your web browser** to the application

**Requirements:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (includes npm)
- [Python 3](https://python.org/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

**After running, you can access:**
- Frontend (Web Interface): http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

#### Detailed Setup Instructions

For detailed setup instructions, troubleshooting, and advanced configuration options, see:
- [Full-Stack App Documentation](./app/README.md)
- [Frontend Documentation](./app/frontend/README.md)  
- [Backend Documentation](./app/backend/README.md)

### ⌨️ Command Line Interface (Advanced)

For developers and advanced users who prefer working with command line tools, you can run the AI Hedge Fund directly via terminal. This approach offers more granular control and is useful for automation, scripting, and integration purposes.

```

You can also specify a `--ollama` flag to run the AI hedge fund using local LLMs.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama

# With Docker (from docker/ directory):
# On Linux/Mac:
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama main

run.bat --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --ollama main
```

You can also specify a `--show-reasoning` flag to print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning

# With Docker (from docker/ directory):
# On Linux/Mac:
./run.sh --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning main

# On Windows:
run.bat --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --show-reasoning main
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions for a specific time period.

```bash
# With Poetry:
poetry run python src/main.py --ticker AAPL,MSFT,NVDA --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
